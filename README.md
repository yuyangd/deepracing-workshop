# REAio_DeepRacing

Welcome to REAio DeepRacing workshop. This workshop is designed to give you hands-on experience with reinforcement learning (RL) by helping you build, train and deploy models in AWS DeepRacer so you can compete with other players.

The workshop will cover the racer's tech spec, how RL drives deepracer, and how to build, train and deploy models.

By the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll have your own optimized RL model going into the competition.
